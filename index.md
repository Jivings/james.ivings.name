My name is James Ivings, a Computer Science graduate from [The University Of The
West Of England](http://uwe.ac.uk). 

I was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, where I reluctantly attended high school.
After achieving A-levels and fending
for myself in the wide world, I discovered my full calling and attended
university to begin my bachelors degree.

I am a passionate developer enticed by software design patterns and new
technologies. I am continually developing, and will use this site to publish my
projects and the issues I encounter. 

Thanks for stopping by, I hope you enjoy your stay.
